# FIC2020-CTF

The __FIC 2020 prequalification challenge__, organized by the __Hexpresso__ team, took place from December 12 to 19, 2019.  
Through __6__ challenges and a final selection test, it allowed 14 teams to select themselves for the final which will take place at the "Forum International de la Cybersécurité" (FIC).  

The format of this CTF was a __"Follow The Rabbit"__: the goal was therefore to advance from step to step, while having to solve each challenge to move to the next. It changes from _Jeopardy_ and brings a certain conductive line.

Here are the different challenges that included the pre-qualifications and the write-ups of those that my team and I passed.  

1. [__First Step for First Flag__ (OSINT/JS)](https://github.com/atz-dev/FIC2020-CTF/blob/master/01-flag.md)

This challenge was realistic and very enriching by the diversity and the complexity of the different challenges, making it very pleasant to make sometimes despite long hours of head taking (but it would not be a CTF otherwise :wink:)
